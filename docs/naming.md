# Naming

"George" is the current working title, but we may rename before release.

## Current Name: George

### The Real Origin Story

The name "George" was chosen for:

- **George Foreman** - grills, dad jokes
- **George Pig** - Peppa's little brother

Sometimes the best names come from silly origins.

### The Retroactive Justification

After picking the name, a more impressive backstory was discovered:

**George Smiley**, John le Carré's patient spymaster from *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy*. Smiley is the quintessential handler - methodical, patient, manages networks of agents, does careful reconciliation of information.

The metaphor genuinely fits: George (the engine) is the handler managing field agents.

We're keeping both origin stories because honesty is important.

## Alternatives Considered

### Top Contenders

| Name | Vibe |
|------|------|
| **george** | Deep cut le Carré reference, unassuming, conversational ("just ask george") |
| **handler** | Direct metaphor, professional, self-documenting |
| **uncle** | UNCLE (Man from UNCLE) vibes, friendly, approachable |
| **agentplane** | Technical, k8s-aligned, enterprise-serious |

### Spy Terminology

These fit the "managing agents" metaphor well:

| Name | Meaning | Fit |
|------|---------|-----|
| **handler** | Person who manages field agents | Perfect metaphor |
| **station** | Base of operations | Where agents are coordinated |
| **dead-drop** | Async message exchange | Git commits as dead drops |
| **control** | Get Smart reference | "We're in CONTROL" |

### K8s-Style Names

| Name | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **reconcili8** | Core pattern, k8s-punny |
| **agentplane** | Like "control plane" |
| **Section-8** | Spy + k8s nod |

### CLI Tool Name

Whatever we name the engine, the CLI could be:

- `agentctl` - k8s-style, clear purpose
- `george` - if we keep the name, CLI is just `george`
- `gctl` - short form
